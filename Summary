\*MongoDB is an object-oriented, simple, dynamic and scalable NoSQL database.
-it's a document database;stores data in documents
-data displayed in JSON format
-and stored in BSON format;supports huge range of data types unlike JSON
-has flexible schema;can work with different data types
-data objects are stored as flexible JSON like documents
-data is stored in a collection instead of rows,columns
-offers high-perfomence,high-availability,horizontal scaling
-has a flexible schema, which means that documents with different structures can be stored in the same collection.

\*object ID - a data type used to create unique identifiers for required \_id field

- If an inserted document doesnâ€™t have an \_id field, MongoDB automatically generates one.

*document is the basic unit of data stored in mongoDB
*collection is a grouping of those documents
\*database a container for collections

\*DATA MODELLING
-is the process of defining hoe data is stored and the relationships between different entities in tour data
-polimephysm- means data can be stored in the same collection can be different
-ask how the user will relate with our database
-not constrined to one method of storing data.

\*types of data relationships
-data accessed together should be stored together
1.one to one - data entity in one set is connected to one data entity in another set
2.one to many - data entity in one set is connected to any number of data entities in another set
3.many to many - any number of entities in one set is connected to any number of entities in another

\*ways to model relationships
-embedding - taking related data and storing it in our document
-referencing - refering to documents in other collections in our document

\*embedding
-involve single queries hence better perfomance
-single opration to add/delete data
-pitfalls : large and unbounded(grows infinitely) documents, duplication
ideal for:
-one to many
-many to many

\*referncing/linking/data normalization
-no duplication
-smaller documents
-pitfall : joining data from different documents
saves the id of one document in another to link the two

\*use atlas tools for schema help
